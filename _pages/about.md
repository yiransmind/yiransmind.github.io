I am a doctoral researcher in Education at the University of Cambridge, where I study **how learners and teachers interact with artificial intelligence** through the lenses of educational technology, educational psychology, psycholinguistics, and human–computer interaction. Before starting my doctorate, I completed an M.Res. in Cognitive Neuroscience at UCL and an Ed.M. in Human Development and Education at Harvard.

I have published in leading journals in these fields, including the *Journal of Computer Assisted Learning*, *International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction*, *Innovation in Language Learning and Teaching*, *System*, and others with more than 300 citations. I also review for a wide range of journals in education, linguistics, psychology, and technology.

I am always keen to collaborate with passionate emerging researchers who share my interests and are motivated to produce high-quality research with a fast publication turnaround, preferably those who already have experience publishing in SSCI/SCI journals.
