I am a doctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge. My research examines **AI-enhanced language education from an interdisciplinary perspective**.  Prior to beginning my doctorate, I completed a Master of Research in Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London and a Master of Education in Human Development and Education at Harvard University.

I have published in several leading journals, including Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction, Innovation in Language Learning and Teaching, and System, among others, with over 300 citations to date. I also serve as an ad hoc reviewer for a broad range of journals in language, education, psychology, and technology.

I am keen to collaborate with motivated early-career researchers who share my research interests and are committed to producing high-quality work with an efficient publication timeline, preferably those with prior experience publishing in SSCI or SCI journals. If you are interested, please contact me at dyr20000801@gmail.com.
