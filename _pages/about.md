I am a doctoral researcher in Education at the University of Cambridge, where I study how learners and teachers interact with artificial intelligence through the lenses of educational technology, educational psychology, psycholinguistics, and human–computer interaction. My research explores AI-mediated language learning, communication, and cognition, and I have published across leading journals including Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction, and Frontiers in Psychiatry. My work has accumulated more than 300 citations.

Before beginning my PhD, I completed an MRes in Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London and an Ed.M. in Human Development and Education at Harvard University. I also serve as an Associate Editor for Educational Engineering and review for a wide range of journals in education, psychology, and technology. Methodologically, I work with experimental designs, mixed methods, EEG/ERP, and machine-learning approaches.
