I am a first-year PhD student in Education at the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on **Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), and Irony**. Prior to beginning my doctorate, I completed a Master of Research in Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London and a Master of Education in Human Development and Education at Harvard University.

I have published 11 SSCI/SCI articles in several leading journals, including *Telematics and Informatics*, *System*, *International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction*, *Journal of Computer Assisted Learning*, among others, with over 400 citations to date. I also serve as an ad hoc reviewer for a broad range of journals in language, education, psychology, and technology.

I am keen to collaborate with motivated early-career researchers who share my research interests and are committed to producing high-quality work with an efficient publication timeline, preferably those with prior experience publishing in SSCI or SCI journals. If you are interested, please contact me at dyr20000801@gmail.com.
